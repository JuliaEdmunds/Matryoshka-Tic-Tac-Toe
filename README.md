# Matryoshka-Tic-Tac-Toe
 
## Project goal
The aim of this project was to create a 3D game that utilises drag-and-drop functionality and learn/practice how to create feel-good animations. The goal was to also allow for local multiplayer and playing against a simple AI.

## Project description
Matryoshka Tic Tac Toe is a turn-based strategy puzzle game that is a twist on the classic game of tic-tac-toe. Players take turns placing 1 out of 6 of their pieces on an empty space or crushing a smaller piece already placed on the board. The player who gets 3 pieces in a row, column or diagonal wins. The Player can play with local friends or against the AI (either in easy or more challenging mode).

This game is available in 6 languages: English, German, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.
